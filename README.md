# Covestro Hackathon (at Carnegie Mellon University)

During this hackathon my team was tasked with predicting the water level of the Rhine river in germany.  We tested several time series analysis models and found that Vectorized Auto-Regression (VAR) had the best results.  Although we can not share the data used (I believe I need to check on that) I will add the jupyter notebook where the analysis was done here.
