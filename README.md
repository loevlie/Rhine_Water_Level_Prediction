# Covestro Hackathon (at Carnegie Mellon University)

During this hackathon my team was tasked with predicting the water level of the Rhine river in germany.  We tested several time series analysis models and found that Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) had the best results.  Although we can not share the data used (I believe I need to check on that). You can find the jupyter notebook where the analysis was done [here](https://github.com/loevlie/Rhine_Water_Level_Prediction/blob/main/VAR_weather_added.ipynb).
